## Vulnerability Management

P4SaMD now allows the real-time detection, tracking, and reporting of vulnerabilities in the system version under development. Following the ISO 81001-5-1, the detected vulnerabilities of the implemented software can be resolved directly in the source code or accepted, reporting a rationale to justify the action.

## Seamless authentication with Single-Sign On

Integrating the Single Sign-On (SSO), the tool offers a seamless login with your Console credentials to access the Software System dashboard.

## New Insights & Suggestions 

New warnings and informational insights for SWI management, including:

- warning of _Undocumented SWI classification_ that guides the user to meet the regulatory requirement of justification for SWI re-classification during the Software System decomposition; 
- inform and highlights the possible mis-classification due to incoherent decomposed SWI class;
- tool also warns the users when the design is missing for an implemented SWI;
- information guidance for setting up important SWI data, in preparation for proper P4SaMD functioning. This rule, referring to _missing RepositoryID_, is now applied only for second and third level SWIs, not on Project-level SWIs. 

## Software Item Management improvements

- **Customizable Software System Settings**: Users can now tailor their system view by including or excluding specific Console Projects, improving clarity and documentation relevance

- **Enhanced SWI Management**: New properties enable better reusability of Software Items (SWI) and ensure comprehensive tracking of approvals and documentation.

## Minor improvements & Bugs

### Dashboard
Graphical improvements of the insights and suggestions counts are introduced, including color coded chips and correct alignments of elements. 

### Test section
For each test, the details now show the entire description to be performed and the current assignee of the test execution.

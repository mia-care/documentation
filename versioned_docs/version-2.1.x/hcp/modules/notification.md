# ðŸ”” Notification Module

## Overview

The **Notification Module** is a core component of the Health Composable Platform (HCP) responsible for managing the communication of time-sensitive and contextual information across multiple channels. It enables the sending of messages such as alerts, reminders, confirmations, and updates to both individual users and user groups via email, SMS, voice calls, WhatsApp, and more.

This module provides powerful tools to create, manage, and deliver personalized notifications based on system events or scheduled triggers, making it crucial for ensuring effective and timely communication in healthcare scenarios.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-channel Support**: Deliver messages via email, SMS, voice, WhatsApp, and push notifications.
- **Template-based Messaging**: Easily create reusable and customizable message templates.
- **Event-driven and Scheduled Messaging**: Notifications can be triggered by system events or scheduled in advance.
- **File Attachments**: Support for attaching documents or reports to notifications.
- **Extensive Integrations**: Seamless integration with other HCP modules and third-party providers.

## Architecture & Microservices

The Notification Module is composed of several independently deployable microservices. Each is responsible for a specific function within the messaging pipeline:

- Register and manage notification templates
- Receive and process events from other platform components
- Route messages to the appropriate channel (email, SMS, etc.)

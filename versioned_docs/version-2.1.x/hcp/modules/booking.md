The **Booking Module** is a key component of the Health Composable Platform (HCP), designed to manage appointments between users of the platform, such as patients, doctors, and other resources. It enables the creation of availability slots, the management of exceptions (e.g., vacations or illnesses), and the booking of appointments. Additionally, it supports the creation of teleconsultations through integration with video conferencing services.

## Microservices Architecture

The Booking Module consists of several microservices working together to provide all the needed functionalities:

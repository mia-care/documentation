sidebar_label: Overview
---

The section allows users to view, create, and edit software items. It provides an intuitive interface for managing software items, including detailed views, adding new entries, and updating existing records. Additionally, using the console, software items are also detected automatically, ensuring efficient and seamless handling of software-related data.

## Create Software Item Design 

1. **Click the "Add software item design" Button**  
   This will open the modal to create a new Software Item.

2. **Fill in the Required Fields**  
   In the modal, you will be prompted to fill out the **Software Item Name** field.  
   When you click on this field, a dropdown will appear. In the dropdown, you can either:  
   - **Enter a new Software Item name**: Type the name you want to assign to the new Software Item and select **Create new**.
   - **Select an existing Software Item**: If a Software Item with the same name and version already exists in the system, you can select it from the list. This will automatically prefill the form with the details of the selected Software Item.
   Fill in the required fields as needed ([Fields description](#fields-description))

3. **Save the New Software Item**  
   Once you've completed the form, click the **"Add software item design"** button at the end of the modal to create and save the new Software Item in the system.

:::tip
You can create a new Software Item starting from an older one: simply select it from the dropdown, then modify the `name` and other fields.

## Software Items Visualization

### Table

![alt text](img/swi_table.png)

The table shows basic info of the tree of software items:

1. **+/-**: Expand/Collapse Software Item children
2. **Software Item**: Name of the Software Item, clickable if the `Implementation link` is filled.
3. **Suggestions**: Count of the suggestions, hover to show a dropdown with a number of how much is in error and in warning. Clicking open modal in the suggestion tab.
4. **SOUP**: Show a label if the Software Item `Is SOUP` is filled or the number of SOUPS children if there are
5. **Safety**: Show a label containing the Software item Safety class 
6. **Design**: Show design status and version
7. **Implementation**: Show Implementation status and detected version
8. `Fast Action | Detail | Three dots`: 
   - **Edit software item design**: Opens a modal to edit the item, following the guidelines in the ([Fields description](#fields-description)).
   - **Download**: Opens a menu to download History and/or Changelog.
   - **Delete item**: Opens a confirmation modal to delete the item.

**N.B.** Every edit of the software item is reflected in all instances.

### Graph  

The graph provides a visual representation of software items, displaying only the first two levels of the hierarchy. Clicking on a box open the related drawer.

![Software Item Graph](img/swi_chart.png)  

Each box contains key details about a software item, including:  
1. **Name** 
2. **Version** 
4. **Count of Suggestions** (shown only if greater than 0)  
3. **Approval Status**
5. **Implementation Status**  
6. **Software Safety Class** (shown only for medical device)

##### **Minimap**  
- The minimap (bottom-right corner) provides an overview of the entire graph, helping users navigate large structures efficiently.  

##### **Caption (Legend)**  
- Located in the top-left corner, the caption explains the different symbols and colors used in the graph, see **Status** of [Software Item States and Related Actions](#software-item-states-and-related-actions) for more infos.

##### **Actions**  
- **Zoom In (+):** Increases the zoom level for a closer view of details.  
- **Zoom Out (-):** Decreases the zoom level for a broader view.  
- **Fit View:** Adjusts the graph to fit within the visible area, ensuring all elements are displayed properly.

## Software Item Drawer

Clicking on a row or the specific button will open a navigable drawer.

From here, you can approve or disapprove a Software Item. <br/>Additionally, all the actions available from the menu inside the table are accessible here as well, just click on the three dots icon in the top right corner.

This is divided into multiple tabs:
- **Detail**: Displays all the fields entered ([Fields description](#fields-description)) for the Software Item.
- **Traceability**: Shows the linked issues (Requirements, Risks, Integration Tests, Changes), which are clickable.
- **Suggestions**: Displays a list of suggestions, if any, to ensure the Software Item meets the ISO standards.

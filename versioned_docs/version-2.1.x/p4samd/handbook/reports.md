# Reports

**Mia-Care P4SaMD** can automatically generate documentation based on information about managed entities, like [risks][risks], requirements, [tests][tests] and [changes][changes], to ensure compliance with most common documentation requirements outlined in international regulation and standards related to SaMD development. 

In the following sections we illustrate the type of documentation you can generate out of the box, how you can do it and which information you can expect to find, but you can also use **Mia-Care P4SaMD** to generate additional documentation based on custom templates. 

:::warning

Documentation completeness and correctness depend on correct and updated information available in the integrated ALM.
If ALM information are missing, incorrect or outdated, the generated documentation may not be generated correctly, lack relevant information or include incorrect or outdated information.

### Is P4SaMD an eQMS?

No, **P4SaMD is not an eQMS**. However, it complements eQMS tools by enhancing their functionality in two key ways:

1. **Integration with eQMS**:  
   P4SaMD integrates seamlessly with your existing eQMS, providing quick access to documents stored in the eQMS directly from its interface. This reduces the need to switch between systems and streamlines workflows.

2. **Policy and Process Enforcement**:  
   P4SaMD enforces the policies and processes defined in your Quality Management System (QMS). For example, it ensures that all development activities comply with procedural requirements outlined in standards like **ISO 13485**, helping teams maintain alignment with regulatory and quality expectations.

While it does not replace an eQMS, P4SaMD serves as a bridge between quality management and software development, ensuring both are tightly integrated and compliant.

### Is P4SaMD an ALM?

No, **P4SaMD is not an ALM (Application Lifecycle Management tool)**, nor is it a project specification management tool like Jira or Matrix Requirements. However, P4SaMD enhances these tools through integrations that provide added value:

- **Integration with ALM and Specification Tools**:  
   P4SaMD integrates with platforms like Jira and Matrix Requirements to link project management and specification data with the software development lifecycle.
  
- **Unified Traceability**:  
   These integrations enable full traceability across the development process, linking requirements, risks, and project specifications to design, implementation, and verification activities.

P4SaMD creates a unified access point for governance and development, ensuring compliance while enhancing productivity and collaboration.

### What is the relationship between Mia-Platform IDP and Mia-Care P4SaMD?

**Mia-Platform IDP** is a robust, general-purpose tool designed to manage the entire software lifecycle. It is domain-agnostic and supports a wide range of software development needs, from source control to CI/CD pipelines.

**Mia-Care P4SaMD**, on the other hand, is an **extension of Mia-Platform IDP**, specifically developed by Mia-Care to address the unique requirements of SaMD development. Here’s how they relate:

- **Mia-Platform IDP** provides the core capabilities for managing software development processes.
- **Mia-Care P4SaMD** adds functionalities required for compliance with **ISO 13485**, **IEC 62304**, **ISO 14971**, and other SaMD-specific standards.

In essence, Mia-Care P4SaMD builds upon the flexibility of Mia-Platform IDP, tailoring it to meet the stringent regulatory demands of SaMD development.

### Does using Mia-Care P4SaMD automatically grant certification?

No, **Mia-Care P4SaMD does not provide automatic certification** for the software developed with it. Mia-Care is not a notified body and therefore cannot certify your product. However:

- **Support for Certification**:  
   Mia-Care has a network of partners, including notified bodies, who can assist you in obtaining certification for your software. P4SaMD facilitates compliance with standards and simplifies the certification process by ensuring that your development process aligns with regulatory requirements.

Using P4SaMD significantly reduces the effort needed to prepare for certification, but the certification itself must be conducted by an authorized body.

### Does Mia-Care P4SaMD share data with third-party organizations?

No, **Mia-Care P4SaMD** does not share any data with external parties. Organizational and technical measures based on international regulations and widely recognized standards are adopted to ensure availability, integrity and confidentiality of data collected from external tools and systems, like ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) tools, Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) toolchains and Identity Providers (IDPs).

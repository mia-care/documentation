      {
        q: "Is P4SaMD an eQMS?",
        a: "No. P4SaMD is not an Electronic Quality Management System (eQMS). It integrates with your eQMS, giving you access from the platform interface to the documents stored there, and it enforces the policies defined in your QMS. It does not replace your eQMS.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is P4SaMD an ALM tool?",
        a: "No. P4SaMD is not an Application Lifecycle Management tool. Version 3 does include native work-item management: requirements, risks, tests, and changes are managed inside the platform. External ALM tools such as Jira are supported as optional integrations with bidirectional synchronization, but they are no longer a prerequisite. P4SaMD works without an existing ALM setup.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does P4SaMD v3 require Mia-Platform Console or any other specific platform?",
        a: "No. P4SaMD version 3 is a standalone platform and does not require Mia-Platform Console to be deployed or in use by your organization. Authentication uses a federated OIDC identity provider that is part of the P4SaMD installation, independent of any third-party platform. This is a change from version 2, which was integrated with Mia-Platform Console.",

    category: "Compliance & Certification",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Is P4SaMD certified as SaMD?",
        a: "No. P4SaMD has no specific intended medical use, so it cannot be certified as Software as a Medical Device. It is validated for use in developing SaMD solutions: the validation confirms that the platform meets the reliability and quality requirements for regulated software development.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is P4SaMD validated for SaMD development?",
        a: "Yes. P4SaMD is validated for use in the development of solutions intended to be certified as SaMD. Validation follows industry guidelines such as GAMP 5 (Good Automated Manufacturing Practice) and GMP Annex 11. For validation documentation, contact Mia-Care.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does using P4SaMD automatically grant regulatory certification?",
        a: "No. P4SaMD does not provide automatic certification for the software developed with it, and Mia-Care is not a notified body. Mia-Care has a network of partners, including notified bodies, who can assist you in obtaining certification. P4SaMD simplifies the preparation by keeping your development activities aligned with regulatory expectations and by generating the required compliance documentation.",

    category: "Integrations",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Can I integrate tools that P4SaMD does not natively support?",
        a: "Yes. P4SaMD exposes APIs you can use to connect it to any tool or technology stack. Your team can build the integrations, or Mia-Care can build them with you.",

  {
    category: "Artificial Intelligence",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How does P4SaMD support Artificial Intelligence features in medical software?",
        a: "P4SaMD includes an AI Validation module for medical software that incorporates machine learning and AI components. The module addresses requirements under the EU AI Act, FDA Good Machine Learning Practices (GMLP), and Predetermined Change Control Plans (PCCP). It manages training datasets, model versions, and performance metrics, and automates assessments of substantial modifications when AI models are updated. The Smart Insight (Whisper) module uses AI to evaluate project artifacts against regulatory rules, identify quality issues in requirements, and highlight gaps in test coverage. An administrator can enable or disable AI-powered features per organization.",

    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Deployment & Architecture",
    items: [
      {
        q: "What deployment models are available?",
        a: "P4SaMD v3 supports three deployment models. Multi-Tenant SaaS is a shared cloud instance managed by Mia-Care, with logical data isolation. Dedicated SaaS gives each customer dedicated cloud infrastructure with physical database isolation. On-Premise is self-hosted by the customer, for complete data sovereignty and air-gapped network support. All three models provide the same feature set.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can multiple teams in my organization use P4SaMD simultaneously?",
        a: "Yes. P4SaMD v3 uses a multi-tenant architecture. Within your organization you can create and manage multiple independent projects, each with its own team, configuration, compliance context, and version history. Users can be assigned to specific projects with role-based access.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens to my v2 configuration if I migrate to v3?",
        a: "P4SaMD v3 is a new platform with a different architecture, so direct in-place migration from v2 to v3 is not supported. To onboard your existing project, the recommended path is the Brownfield Import feature in v3: it performs a compliance gap analysis and generates a remediation plan. For migration support, contact Mia-Care.",

# üè• EHR Module ‚Äì Electronic Health Record

## Overview

The **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** module serves as the central hub for managing patient clinical data within the Health Composable Platform (HCP).  
It provides a unified, structured, and interoperable system that aggregates information from various sources, ensuring a comprehensive view of each patient's medical history.  
Designed with modularity and scalability in mind, the EHR module facilitates seamless integration with other healthcare systems and standards, notably HL7 FHIR.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Data Management**: Consolidates patient information from multiple systems into a single, accessible record.
- **Standards Compliance**: Supports healthcare interoperability standards like FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Ensures that patient data is current, facilitating timely clinical decisions.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Maintains data security by restricting access based on user roles.
- **Audit Trails**: Keeps detailed logs of data access and modifications for compliance and monitoring purposes.

## Microservices Architecture

The EHR module is composed of several microservices that work in tandem to provide robust and flexible healthcare data management:

### 1. Form Service Backend

The **Form Service Backend** acts as the backend-for-frontend (BFF) for the form management system.  
It handles API requests related to form creation, retrieval, submission, and versioning.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Form Schema Management: Create, update, and retrieve form templates.
- Form Submission Handling: Manage user-submitted data, including drafts and final submissions.
- Versioning Support: Maintain multiple versions of form data for historical reference.
- Export Functionality: Export form data in CSV format for reporting and analysis.

**Documentation:**

- [Form Service Backend Configuration](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/docs/next/runtime_suite/form-service-backend/configuration)

### 2. Form Service Frontend

The **Form Service Frontend** provides a user interface for building and visualizing forms.  
It leverages [formio.js](https://formio.github.io/formio.js/) to offer a customizable form builder and renderer.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Form Builder: Allows users to design custom forms using a drag-and-drop interface.
- Form Visualizer: Enables users to fill out and submit forms.
- Styling Support: Customize the appearance of forms to match organizational branding.
- Integration Options: Can be integrated as a micro-frontend or within a headless CMS.

### 3. FHIR Adapter

The **FHIR Adapter** enables interoperability between systems that implement the FHIR standard and those that do not.  
It allows for the saving and retrieval of FHIR data from a FHIR Server using non-standard JSON payloads, utilizing configurations to map fields between non-standard JSON and standard FHIR JSON formats.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Data Mapping: Translate non-standard JSON to FHIR-compliant JSON and vice versa.
- CRUD Operations: Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on FHIR resources.
- Versioning and History: Access historical versions of FHIR resources.
- File Management: Upload and download files associated with FHIR resources.

### 4. Mia FHIR Server

The **Mia FHIR Server** is a microservice that fully implements the FHIR standard, based on HAPI FHIR, an open-source Java implementation.  
It is responsible for exposing, storing, and validating FHIR resources as defined by the standard.  
The server supports HL7 FHIR releases DSTU3, R4, and R5.

**Key Capabilities:**

- FHIR Compliance: Full support for FHIR standards and resources.
- RESTful API: Expose FHIR resources via RESTful APIs.
- Web Application and Swagger Interface: User-friendly interfaces for interacting with FHIR resources.
- Versioning and History: Access to specific versions and history of FHIR resources.

- [Mia FHIR Server Configuration](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/docs/runtime_suite/mia-fhir-server/configuration)

## Configurability

The EHR module's form services are highly configurable, allowing healthcare providers to tailor forms to specific clinical needs.

**Custom Form Creation:**

- **Anamnesis Forms**: Collect detailed patient medical histories.
- **Therapy Monitoring**: Track ongoing treatments and patient responses.
- **Assessment Tools**: Implement standardized health assessments and scales.

**Form Assignments:**

Forms can be assigned to specific users or groups, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access and submit sensitive information.

**Styling and Theming:**

Customize the look and feel of forms to align with organizational branding, enhancing user experience and consistency.

**Version Control:**

Maintain multiple versions of forms and submissions, enabling historical data analysis and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Integration and Extensibility

The EHR module is designed for seamless integration with other HCP modules and external systems:

- **Interoperability**: Supports integration with national and regional health information systems.
- **API Access**: Provides RESTful APIs for data exchange and system interoperability.
- **Modular Design**: Can be extended with additional microservices to meet evolving healthcare needs.

## Conclusion

The EHR module of the Health Composable Platform offers a flexible, secure, and comprehensive solution for managing patient health records.  
Its modular architecture, combined with powerful form management capabilities and FHIR integration, empowers healthcare providers to deliver personalized and coordinated care.

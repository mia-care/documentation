## Performance Improvements

The v2.3.1 introduces significant performance improvements through a comprehensive refactor of the view architecture. This enhancement boosts read time response and significantly improves the overall performance of P4SaMD, providing users with a faster and more responsive experience.

## Test Execution Enhancements

### Job ID Generation

P4SaMD now generates job IDs during test execution to handle cases where the test executor does not return a job ID after triggering a test. This improvement ensures more reliable test tracking and traceability.

For more details on test suite execution, please refer to the [Automatic Test Suite Execution](../handbook/verification.md#automatic-test-suite-execution) section in the Verification handbook.

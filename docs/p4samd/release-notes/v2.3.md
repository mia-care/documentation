## Verification and Testing

P4SaMD allows a comprehensive **Verification and Testing management**: *Test Suites* were introduced to allow the users to logically group automatic and manual tests. The new feature enables the execution of automatic tests and the automatic retrieval of outcomes from integrated tools. 
Traceability is automatically maintained and a standardized format is provided for effortless reporting.

## Compliance Documentation Engine

New Compliance Documentation Engine is now available to streamline compliance by automating the generation of regulated artifacts. 
A default IEC 62304-compliant templates set is provided to allow users a quick startup: templates can be extensively customized thanks to our editor and enriched by system data through provided variables and custom structure. 
Once the desired template is ready, the documentation can be generated and downloaded in the preferred format for every version of your Software System. 

## Roles & Permissions

The v2.3 improves the Roles & Permissions management, allowing to map every P4SaMD permission to the centralized roles of the Mia-Platform IDP. Each company can now integrate the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) flows in the tool, creating configured working paths for each user role. 


## Minor Improvements & Bug fix

### Vulnerability Clarity
 
 Hovering over CVSS scores in the Vulnerabilities table now shows a tooltip detailing the scoring standard and total scale.
### Improved navigation & Quick Access

URLs in fields (like SWI implementation links) are now clickable.
### Risk Visibility

The Risk Management section now clearly reports the status of each risk in a dedicated column.
### Expanded Coverage

Vulnerabilities are now detected for SWIs of the "Other" type.
### Table Consistency fix

Sorting tables by column now correctly resets pagination to page 1.

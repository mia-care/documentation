# Release Note v2.2

## Vulnerability Management

P4SaMD now allows the real-time detection, tracking, and reporting of vulnerabilities in the system version under development. Following the ISO 81001-5-1, the detected vulnerabilities of the implemented software can be resolved directly in the source code or accepted, reporting a rationale to justify the action.

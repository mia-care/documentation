# Risks

## Overview

The Table provides an overview of potential issues identified in the **P4SaMD** project. Each row in the table represents a **P4SaMD Risk entity in Jira**.  

The risks displayed in the table originate from the integrated ALM, where they are created, updated, and edited. The table dynamically reflects any changes made in the ALM, ensuring up-to-date risk assessment.

## Table  

- **Title**: A brief description of the identified risk and a link to the Jira Issue represented by its Key.  
- **Suggestions**: The number of suggestions related to the risk. Visit [Insight & Suggestions](./insight_and_suggestions) 
- **Probability**: A numerical value indicating the likelihood of the risk occurring.  
- **Severity**: A numerical value representing the potential impact of the risk.  
- **Risk Level**: The resulting value of risk obtained by the mutiplication of P and S. [Levels](#levels)
- **Residual Risk**: The remaining level of risk after mitigation measures are applied, given by the multiplication of Mitigated P and Mitigated S. [Levels](#levels)
- **RCM**: The number of linked risk control measures that mitigate the risk.
- **Software Items**: The number of software items affected by the risk.  
- **Changes**: The number of modifications applied to the risk.  

### Actions

Under the last column on the table you can perform the following actions:

- **Link Software Items**: by clicking on the link icon, you can link a software item to the risks or unlink an already associated one. The linked software items are displayed in the drawer under the **Traceability** tab.

## Drawer  

Clicking on a row opens a **drawer** displaying detailed information about the selected risk.

The drawer shows risk related information into three tabs: **Details**, **Traceability** and **Suggestions**.

You can navigate between the linked entities - changes, risks and software items - by selecting them under the *Traceability* section in the detailed view.

You can browse back to previous entities by accessing the history menu at the top of the detailed view and selecting the entity of interest.

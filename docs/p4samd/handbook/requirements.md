The section allows users to view requirements created on the integrated ALM and leverage AI to evaluate them and collect suggestions for improvement according to *IEC 62304*.

In the requirements table you can see the icons indicating the evaluation status of each requirement:

| Evaluation        | Icon                                                                                          |

## Requirement evaluation

:::danger

When performing an evaluation using AI, several information about the requirement are shared with the AI service provider, in particular title, description and linked risks, tests and software items.

Therefore you should check the AI service provider privacy policy and terms of service, to ensure their data processing policies are fully compliant with applicable regulations and company policies, especially if sensitive or confidential information may be involved.

For [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), you can find these information at the following links:

- [GDPR compliance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr)
- [Terms of Use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/termsofuse)
- [Data Protection Addendum](https://aka.ms/DPA)
- [Data, privacy, and security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy)

Always remember that information generated by AI may be inaccurate or misleading, so never make any assumption or decision based solely on those information and always verify them first. 

:::

You can assess the conformity of a SaMD requirement by hovering on the gray icon in the corresponding table row and click on the `Get evaluation` button.

The assessment may take a while, usually around a minute, so while we process it in the background you can keep working on P4SaMD and come back to check the progress at any time.

After the evaluation has been completed, the icon on the table is going to assume different colors depending on the overall rating and, by hovering it, you can see a preview of the results.

| Evaluation        | Preview                                                                                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Very low quality  | ![Very low quality evaluation](img/requirements/requirements_evaluation_very_low_quality_modal.png)   |
| Low quality       | ![Low quality evaluation](img/requirements/requirements_evaluation_low_quality_modal.png)             |
| High quality      | ![High quality evaluation](img/requirements/requirements_evaluation_high_quality_modal.png)           |
| Very high quality | ![Very high quality evaluation](img/requirements/requirements_evaluation_very_high_quality_modal.png) |

The rating provides an overall score, which is the result of the aggregation of four different scores on specific criteria:

- **Clarity and Specificity**: if the requirement is clear, detailed and unambiguous;
- **Traceability**: if the requirement is uniquely identified and is linked to risks and software items;
- **Testability and Verification**: if the requirement is easy to test and verify;
- **Completeness**: if the requirement contains all information expected by *IEC 62304*.

If you select the row, in the modal on the right side of the page, under the **Suggestions** tab, you can see detailed information about the evaluation.
At the top you can see a **suggested description**, which provides an example of how you could rewrite your requirement to address its main weaknesses.
Also, you can check how it scored on each specific criteria mentioned above, including the specific areas of strength and weakness.
